# CANoe_Project
ECE student CAN project made using Vector's CANoe software.

##Personal indications:

**This project was built using four components:**

	* CANoe
	* CANdb
	* CAN Panel Editor
	* CAPL Browser

  
The CAPL Editor allows us to define the behaviour of each CAN network node
	=> **A CAPL file per node.**
